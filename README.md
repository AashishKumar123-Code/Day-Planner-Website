#Daily Planner Website 
#Brainwave Matrix Solutions Internship Project
Author - Aashish Kumar

This project is a minimalist daily planner application, meticulously crafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It represents a significant learning outcome from my web development internship at Brainwave Matrix Solutions. Through its development, I focused on:

Strengthening foundational HTML for semantic structure.
Mastering CSS for modern and responsive design principles.
Implementing JavaScript for interactive features like task management (add, edit, delete) and local storage integration for data persistence.
This application serves as a testament to practical front-end development skills gained during the internship, emphasizing clean code and user experience.
